# CrossFit

This is a quick exercise to create a mobile site for www.crossfit.com.  The primary user will be someone who works out irregularly and will want access to the most relevent informtion.  The site has been simplified to those specifications.  The menu shows muliple links, but only the 'find a trainer' and 'where to start' views have been completed.
